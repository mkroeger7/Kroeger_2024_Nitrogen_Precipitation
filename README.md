# Kroeger_2024_Nitrogen_Precipitation

This repository contains the raw data files nececessary to repeat the detailed statistical analyses included in Kroeger et al. 2024. Simulated nitrogen deposition and precipitation events alter microbial carbon cycling during early stages of litter decomposition.

The files are the following:
1. AllNutrientMetrics.xlsx
2. MoistureData.xlsx
3. MCT_CO2_timecourse.xlsx

AllNutrientMetrics file contains the measured carbon and nitrogen pools for all samples. The reported metrics are microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, cumulative CO2, microbial carbon use efficiency, cumulative dissolved organic carbon (DOC), cumulative dissolved total nitrogen (TN), and the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2). All metadata for the experimental design are reported in this file as well. Outliers have been removed and negative values for microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were removed except for the negative controls. These negative values are considered below the detection limit. 

The MoistureData file contains the moisture content for all samples and the treatment metadata.

The MCT_CO2_timecourse file contains the original CO2 (%) measured, the calculated cumulative values over time, and the conversion from percent to mg CO2/g litter.
